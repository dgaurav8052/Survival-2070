# **Survival 2070**

**Survival 2070** is a futuristic **resource management dashboard** built with **HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript**.
It simulates the tracking of essential survival resources like **Food, Water, Energy, and Days Left**, and provides a clean, futuristic interface with **visual indicators, alerts, and animations**.

### **Features**

* **Futuristic Neon UI** → Animated background grid with glowing effects.
* **Real-time Resource Tracking** → Food, Water, Energy, Credits, and Survival Days Left.
* **Resource Decay Simulation** → Supplies gradually decrease over time, simulating real-world consumption.
* **Buy Supplies Function** → Replenish Food and Water at the cost of Credits.
* **Dynamic Status Indicators**:

  * **System Status:** Optimal → Caution → Critical
  * **Resource Levels:** Stable → Low → Critical
  * **Mission Time:** Extended → Limited → Emergency
* **Smart Alerts** → Automatic warnings when any resource hits a critical level.
* **Fully Responsive** → Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.

### **Technologies Used**

* *HTML5* → Structure of the dashboard
* *CSS3 (Tailwind CSS)* → Styling, futuristic neon UI, and responsive design
* *JavaScript (ES6)* → Real-time simulation, alerts, and resource logic


### **How It Works**

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Monitor resources in real-time — Food, Water, Energy, and Credits.
3. Use **Buy Supplies** to increase Food and Water (costs Credits).
4. Resources automatically **decay over time**, simulating survival pressure.
5. System triggers **alerts** and updates **status indicators** when critical thresholds are reached.

### **Additional Notes**

* Currently, the resource digits **auto-increase/decrease by simulation** since **no external device (e.g., smartwatch, smart band, health chip, IoT sensor)** is connected.
* In future, this system could be integrated with **wearable devices or survival chips** to provide **real biometric and environmental data** for a more immersive survival dashboard.
